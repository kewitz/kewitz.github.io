title: Building things from Scratch, once again.

I finally did it. I finally updated my website.
But the interesting part of all this isn't exactly the code, it's the fact that I can never be happy using a default framework like Jekyll or Hexo.

No, I need to spend 4 hours *building* something from scratch, because I and only I know exactly what I need.

I recognize that I have this problem, that I always need to reinvent the wheel. But I guess this is how it works, some people rather build wheels than go out for a spin.
